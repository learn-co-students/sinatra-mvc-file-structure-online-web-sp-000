# This directory holds the code that will be displayed in the browser.
# In a Sinatra app we use .erb files instead of .html files because .erb files allow us to include regular,
# old HTML tags AND special erb tags which contain Ruby code. 
# GET request to / typically renders a file called index.erb
# Views represent how things look and are displayed in our application
# We've already told the controller how to load this file in the view
